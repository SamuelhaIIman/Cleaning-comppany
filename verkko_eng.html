	<p class="tietoturva"><b>Fishing for personal data and bank codes</b>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>Phishing is the illegal acquisition of any financially exploitable information, such as online banking credentials, credit card numbers or personal data.For example, you may receive a message asking you to immediately log in to the service with your banking credentials under threat of account closure. Clicking on the link in the message will open a webpage that looks like your bank's website - this is likely to be a scammer fishing for your bank account, credit card or personal data, and intending to use the information you provide for criminal purposes. The scammer may also masquerade as a payment order or account information service provider that appears trustworthy.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><b>Recognize</b>
	<p>
	<ul class="henktiedot1">
		<li>Phishing messages and other scams are often disguised to look like customer service messages from well-known companies. </li>
		<li>The websites to which the information is requested may look like those operated by a financial institution, an authorised payment service provider or a registered account service provider, but they are scam sites where the information entered ends up in the hands of criminals.</li>
		<li>The justification for requesting information is, for example, that identifiers need to be updated or otherwise verified.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="tietoturva2"><b>Prevent</b>
	<ul class="henktiedot2">
		<li>Keep your firewall and antivirus up to date..</li>
		<li>Only provide information about yourself that is necessary for the transaction or purchase.</li>
		<li>Do not respond to any messages asking for your personal information or your account and credit card details. Also, do not click on the links in those messages.</li>
		<li>Remember that trustworthy companies do not ask for IDs, credit card numbers or other confidential information via email. You can always check with your bank to see if they have sent you a query.</li>
		<li>Do not rely on the contents of the FROM field of the email. The FROM field of an email can easily be forged to, for example, <a href="mailto:asiakapalvelu@omapankkisi.fi">asiakaspalvelu@omapankkisi.fi</a>.</li>
		<li>Also remind your children not to pass on personal information online.</li>
		<li>If you are asked for your personal data on the internet, please first check the "Privacy" or "Privacy Policy" section on the website of the person asking you. Under this heading, there should be information about what material is collected from visitors to the page, how the data is used and how it is stored. If this information is not there, you should carefully consider whether it is worth disclosing it.</li>

	<p class="haittaohjelmat"><b>Malware</b>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>Malicious software is software that is designed to damage or perform malicious actions on a computer system. 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Computer virus</i> is a small program that spreads from one computer to another and interferes with the computer's operation. A computer virus can corrupt or delete data on your computer, spread to other computers through an email program, or even erase the entire contents of your hard drive. 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Worm</i> is computer code that spreads without user intervention. Most worms spread as email attachments that infect the computer when opened. The worm searches the infected computer for files containing email addresses, such as address lists and temporary web pages. The worm sends infected email messages to the addresses and mimics (or spoofs) the sender's address in subsequent emails so that these messages appear to come from a familiar sender.   
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Trojan horse</i> is a malicious program that hides inside other programs. It enters the computer inside a decent program, such as a screen saver. It then injects the code into the operating system, allowing the hacker to use the infected computer. Trojan horses do not usually spread on their own. They are spread by viruses, worms or downloaded software. 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Spyprograms</i> can be installed on your computer without your knowledge. These programs may change your computer settings or collect advertising and personal information. Spyware can track Internet browsing habits and also redirect the browser to a different site than the one the user is about to visit.

	<p class="salasanat"><b>Password security</b>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>The generally accepted recipe for a secure password is as follows:</i>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>The length of the password is a bit of a moot point. For example, in the past, 8 characters was considered sufficient. Nowadays, for example, cert-fi recommends that it should be at least 15 characters. In other words, soon we can already talk about a cipher in general! 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>The password must be easy to remember</i>
	<br>If the password is too difficult, it often needs to be remembered. However, people are generally lazy enough to write it down at some point, for example on a piece of paper. 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Password must not be guessable</i>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>The names of family members, relatives, friends and pets are bad passwords because they are easy to guess. If you had to guess someone's password, you'd probably start guessing from this list. Hobbies and other interests are also bad passwords as such. 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Password length matters</i>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>Modern computers are powerful enough computing machines that passwords that are too short can be cracked with a reasonable amount of effort. The idea is that the computer runs through each option until it finds the right one. As an example, the machine could look for the right one in a 3-character password by first testing aaa, then aab, aac, aad and so on. The longer the password, the more options you have to go through!
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Letters, numbers and special characters</i>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>Referring to the previous example, if only lower case letters are used, it is sufficient for the machine to test the characters a to e. If there are also numbers, the list will grow again with the characters 0-9. If you add special characters! (#%& etc.), the list will continue to grow. A longer list takes more time to scroll through. 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Can you find it in the dictionary or not?</i>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>If you were trying to guess someone's password, you would probably try certain words in a certain order, right? You would have a list of certain words that you were going to try. As I said, modern machines are so powerful that they do the same operation very quickly. So it should come as no surprise that it doesn't take long to go through a list of thousands of words, for example. The machine will go through the list until it finds the right word. Unless, of course, your password is not on that list! 
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br><i>Different password for each system</i>
	<br>&nbsp;
	<br>If it happens that your password for system X is compromised, don't worry if you have used a different password for system Y. So the disclosure of one piece of information will not compromise other pieces of information!
